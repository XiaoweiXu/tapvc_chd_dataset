Whole Heart and Great Vessel Segmentation for Surgical Planning of Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connections

The dataset is collected from Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, consisting of cardiac CT images from 92 patients. The size of the images is 512× 512×(137-251), and
the typical voxel size is 0.25×0.25×0.5mm3. Our data are precisely annotated by experienced radiologists, with each CT image taking about 1 hour to annotate. This dataset mainly includes 10 labels including LV, RV, LA, RA, AO, PA, Myo,
SVC, IVC, and PV, respectively.


The dataset is still under preparation. Please send emails to xiao.wei.xu@foxmail.com for any questions.
